Many Input and Output Examples have been forked from Rebecca Fiebrink's Wekinator Examples and re-ordered into specific themed folders for teaching.

Some of some stand alone OfX OSC apps (Kinect, Leap, Audio, Covnet and Ableton) are forked from ML4A, Andreas Refsgaard and Gene Kogan.

Examples for 
- Myo Band,
- DMX,
- Bare Conductive / Capacitive Touch,
- Max Msp Audio Playlist,
- Max Msp Video Playlist. 

are written by me adapting the same OSC code structure Rebecca Fiebrink sets up in her examples.
